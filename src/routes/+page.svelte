	<h1>LyghtCode's Digital Vinyl NFT</h1>

	<p>
		This small web app exists within an NFT. The idea is to condense an entire album into a single
		NFT Collectible where the user may also playlist the album inside the NFT. This allows for a few
		things the first being the entire experience can be enjoyed in the metaverse or virtual NFT
		Gallery. The second this showcases how interactive NFT's can be. If a webapp can exist within an
		NFT then what else can be created???? No more monkey jpgs!
