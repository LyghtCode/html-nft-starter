	<h1>Life After Life - Bob Peace - Digital Vinyl NFT</h1>

	<p style="text-align: center;">
		Few cool perks we're doing are: 1) After 555 sold buyer can redeem NFT for vinyl "Life After
		Life" album (buy extra so you have digital and physical!). 2) Via TokenProof hoping to procure
		some IRL benefits such as discounts at local businesses, etc., simply by presenting and
		verifying your NFT (see bobpeace.io for list of participating establishments). 3) After 777 sold
		3% of sales will be donated to Children's Hospital of Los Angeles for the remainder of the 1,111
		NFTs. When creating this piece, I wanted to highlight the light and color we obtain when
		overcoming being broken. The love for ourselves we feel once we become our own person. The
		flowing energy that explodes out of us once we become who we are meant to be. Being broken can
		always be fixed. For more info please visit bobpeace.io
