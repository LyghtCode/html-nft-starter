	<h1>Life After Life - Bob Peace - Digital Vinyl NFT</h1>

	<p style="text-align: center;">
		I’m going to give y’all a few thoughts
		on this album so you know what the f is going on whilst listening. Firstly, thank you to the
		Collectors - I’m nothing without y’all so thanks! Y’all are now Peacekeepers in my book so let’s
		get it :-)
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		Lay With Me - this track I did in Spring 2017 it was after my girl and I split up and then we
		was getting back together so this is like my lil’ track to her like yo ‘where yo head at what’s
		the deal?’
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		Try And Fly High - if I ain’t wrong this was spring 2017 after a terrible roommate situation and
		heading up to Malibu from SD and then getting back to SD and sitting at the ocean with my dogs
		thinking like ‘man what am I doing with my life with this music ya know I should be in LA but
		dang like I chose this so let’s go.’
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		Broken Child - this was like the first track I wrote for this record it was I think late 2016 I
		think this was the first joint we did it’s all about being honest and vulnerable like I was a
		virgin heading off to college and I’m still a paranoid son of a mother lmfao.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		Enjoy Wildly On The Run - I wrote this down at Sunset Cliffs with a beater ass guitar I had
		bought at Guitar Center whilst in LA cuz I had to escape my living situation and aint have no
		time to get my guitar ya feel me? Like my life is nuts.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		Fall Into The Sky - this the only joint on the record that wasn’t new, it was from 2010. I love
		this tune cuz I aint find my truth til 2011 so this like ‘tell me how to love God!!!’
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		Misery Loves Company -this first lyric bout a diff bad roommate but it’s like dang man how come
		mf love to be miserable and drag all down with them?!? Crazy world.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		How Many Days? - I love cigarettes. Idfaf. I absolutely love tobacco. I think I only love the
		ocean more. Anyhow, wrote this late one night in ob like musing ‘how many days on this planet we
		get?’
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		We Don’t Know Why - wrote this spring 2017 in Encinitas f guy who lived w me gave me ish about
		being quiet while I’m writing grammy winning songs LFG!!!
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">Reach The Sky - f love this tune. Jus sweet.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		Brokenhearted - wrote this on a deck in ob this was the last joint we did in January 2018 when I
		got back from performing at a conference in hollywood. I was in go mode. Fav track on the
		record. This record dedicated to my two pups Magic and Molasses who rode w me through all the
		crazy times when I had to deal w gnarly humans all over this country. As always, all praise is
		due to God cuz I’d be dead without him. Love to Jesus, as well. ENJOY!!! - peacer
